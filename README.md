*"The Universe is under no obligation to make sense to you."* — Neil deGrasse Tyson

Just a curious human who codes | Student at the European Institute of Technology ([EPITECH](https://www.epitech.eu/))

## Currently tinkering with...

[**nook.nvim**](https://github.com/alejandrolaguna20/nook.nvim) - A tiny Neovim plugin for my task management that probably only makes sense to me (and that's okay!)

## Behind the keyboard

First-year CS student who enjoys the art of elegant problem-solving and occasionally staring at error messages until they start making sense (they tend to... not do that.

I like my code like I like my desk - minimalist yet slightly chaotic.
