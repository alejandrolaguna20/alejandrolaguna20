# Alejandro Laguna

1st-year computer science student at **EPITECH**. Passionate about mathematics, physics, astronomy, and literature. I enjoy blending my love for science with technology to build tools that solve real-world problems. Currently working on **CoderType**, a tool that helps developers improve their typing skills through real code from open-source projects.

## Projects

### **CoderType**  
A typing practice tool for developers, using real code from open-source repositories. Built with the **TALL** stack.

## Currently Working On  
- Expanding CoderType with new features and challenges to make typing practice more engaging and useful.  
- Continuously learning and exploring how technology can intersect with my passions for mathematics, physics, and astronomy.
