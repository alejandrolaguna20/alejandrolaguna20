## Things that matter to me
My favorite writer is Isaac Asimov, my favorite piece of music is Spiegel im Spiegel, and my favorite book is The Witches by Roald Dahl. My favorite star is Vega because it was once our north star and will be again in about 12,000 years - something poetic about that cycle.
